## What is X-Browser?
X-Browser mixes the best of both worlds when developing for web: a rich text editor with autocomplete functionality and real time testing.  Upon saving your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript file your code will come to life to  live in a multi browser view. Seeing your site running in major browsers like Chrome and Firefox all at once allows for better testing and compatibility checking. With X-Browser, you wont need to leave your editor to make sure your site is the best it can be!
